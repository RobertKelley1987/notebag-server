## Overview

[Live Demo](https://notebag.site)

<!-- This is the client for a notes app heavily influenced by Google Keep. For some
reason notes apps are the web app I end up using the most, and I've always wanted
to build my own. I ended up creating the backend for this project as well, so
it turned out to be a substantial build.

I feel like I have a better understanding of React's context hooks than I did
before I started. I feel like I am also getting better at writing custom hooks.
I have never finished a project that required this many files before, so folder
structure is a challenge. I might need to do more research on best practices
for React project organization.

I went into this project determined to use React Router's loader functions with
a design pattern applying the Suspense and Await elements, only to find that this
pattern is not what I needed for an SPA. I enjoyed trying out these features,
but because I utlimately didn't use them, I feel like I could have saved a lot of
time by researching this first... oh well. You live and you learn. -->

### Built With

<!-- - [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindcss.com) -->

## Features

<!-- - JWT Auth - User sessions are tracked using JWT tokens, so logged in users do not
  need to re-enter their email and password until tokens expire.
- Tags - Notes can include any number of tags, which then be used to filter notes.
- Search bar - Users can filter notes by a search term.
- Pinned notes - Notes can be marked as favorites via "pinned" status, and pinned
  notes will be kept at the top of the app. -->

## Acknowledgements

<!-- I would never have finished this app without [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI8PYZNFtac&t=1056s) by Dave Gray on JWTs. I had no clue how to handle JWTs in React before
this project and his channel was extremely helpful. -->
